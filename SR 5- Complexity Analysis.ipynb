    "### Time and Space Complexity of Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is a classic algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Case: O(1)\n",
    "- The best case occurs when the target element is the middle element of the array on the first check.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average Case: O(log n)\n",
    "- In the average case, the algorithm will divide the array in half on each step, reducing the size of the search interval exponentially. This results in a logarithmic time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worst Case: O(log n)\n",
    "- The worst case happens when the target element is not in the array or is located at the extreme end of the array. Even in this scenario, the array is halved each step, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "- Binary search requires a constant amount of additional space. It uses only a few variables (such as pointers for the low, high, and middle indices) regardless of the input size. Therefore, its space complexity is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency in Terms of Big-O Notation\n",
    "- Binary search is highly efficient for searching within sorted arrays due to its logarithmic time complexity, O(log n). This means that even as the size of the dataset grows significantly, the number of steps required to find the target element increases very slowly. "
